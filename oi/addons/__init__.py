""" Addons module.

This module serves to contain all Oi addons, across all configured addons
paths. For the code to manage those addons, see oi.modules.

Addons are made available under `oi.addons` after
oi.tools.config.parse_config() is called (so that the addons paths are
known).

This module also conveniently reexports some symbols from oi.modules.
Importing them from here is deprecated.
